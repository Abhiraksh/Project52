Facts about Turtles!
</br>
1. Turtles belong to one of the oldest reptile groups in the world – beating snakes, crocodiles and alligators!
</br>
2. These creatures date back to the time of the dinosaurs, over 200 million years ago – woah!
</br>
3. Turtles are easily recognised by their bony, cartilaginous shell. This super-tough casing acts like a shield to protect them from predators – some turtles can even tuck their head up inside their shell for extra protection!

    ABOUT FISH!
</br>
    All fish share two traits: they live in water and they have a backbone—they are vertebrates.
    Apart from these similarities, however, many of the species in this group differ markedly from one another. Fin fish like salmon have gills, are covered in scales, and reproduce by laying eggs. Eels, by contrast, have worm-like bodies and exceedingly slimy skin. Lungfish gulp air. Whale sharks, the largest fish, give birth to live young and eat only tiny fish, squid, and plankton. 
    Some species, such as the weedy sea dragon, are so bizarre they seem almost unreal.
